### Major  Chunks
* ~~create a Simulator class- this is the guy that sets up the cloud env~~
* ~~create an AuditService Class- this is the service that calls verification algos on broker~~
* Make a Provisioning request depend on more factors (like ram, space, etc.) instead of just mips
	* Make the datacenter have additional characteristics as above
* Make a bottleneck class?


### Minor tweaks
* ~~Include a config file, and make all programs read from that~~



# TODO
