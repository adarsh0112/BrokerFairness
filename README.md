# Broker Fairness Verification in Hybrid Cloud Systems

This project aims to verify vendor-neutrality of a cloud broker. This verification is offered as a service to a customer who would like to know if a certain broker is being fair.



## External Library Used

This project uses [Cloudsim-4.0](http://www.cloudbus.org/cloudsim/) to simulate a cloud system.

## Changelog
